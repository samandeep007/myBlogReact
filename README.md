## How to handle .env files in vite

When working with Vite, it is recommended to include the prefix `VITE_` while declaring environment variables. This is because Vite uses a different approach to handle environment variables compared to traditional bundlers like webpack.

By including the `VITE_` prefix, Vite can automatically expose these variables to your application at build time. This means that you can access these variables directly in your code using `import.meta.env`. For example, if you have a variable named `API_KEY` declared in your `.env` file, you can access it in your code like this: `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY`.

Using `import.meta.env` provides a convenient way to access environment variables without the need for additional configuration or dependencies. It also ensures that your environment variables are properly bundled and optimized during the build process.

Remember to keep your `.env` file secure and avoid committing it to version control systems. Instead, use a `.env.local` file for local development and provide environment-specific variables through your deployment process.
